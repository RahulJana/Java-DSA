* The int type in Java can be used to represent any whole number from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
* Why those numbers? Integers in Java are represented in 2â€™s complement binary and each integer gets 32 bits of space.
* In 32 bits of space with one bit used to represent the sign you can represent that many values.
* Why is there one more negative number than positive number? It is because 0 is considered a positive number.
* What do the last two lines print out? Did this surprise you?
* Java will actually return the maximum integer value if you try to subtract one from the minimum value.
* This is called underflow. And, Java will return the minimum integer value if you try to add one to the maximum.
* This is called overflow. It is similar to how odometers work. When would you ever use Integer.MIN_VALUE or Integer.MAX_VALUE?
* They are handy if you want to initialize a variable to the smallest possible value and then search a sequence of values for a larger value.
